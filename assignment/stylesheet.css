html, 
header{
    background-color: dark grey;
    color: light green;
    text-align: center;
}
<main>
background-color: dark grey;
</main>

body{
    background-color: light grey;
    margin: 0;
}









Stylesheet:

Create a `stylesheet.css` file and source it into the HTML file.
Give the `header` a dark background color and choose a light  color for the text.
Center the text in the `header`.

my questions - 
1. must be sourcing in my css to html wrong, as not reflecting online
2. main? where and how to write this? 
3. how to look up bakground image poperty?
- Give the `main` a light grey background color. //// I made this the 'body'?
- Look up the CSS `background-image` property to learn how to use the provided `record.png` as the background image on your page with a relative path.
- Look up CSS `background-repeat` to learn how to fill the body of the page with a repeating image.
- Look up CSS `margin` and `padding`. 
 Give the `body` a margin of `0`. (This removes the whitespace around the edges of the page.) 
  - Give the `main` padding of `1em`. (Curious about `em`? Look up CSS units.)

Here's an example of what the style could look like:
